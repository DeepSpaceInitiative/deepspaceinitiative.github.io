								<p>Astronaut Health & Performance</p>
								<p>Since the beginning of time, we humans have looked up to the skies for answers. Over the centuries, many have come up with ideologies that have helped civilization move forward. We now live in an era with increased scientific breakthroughs that are helping shape our understanding of our cosmos. Our innate curiosity about the universe distinguishes us from all other beings on Earth, and it is the main driver pushing us to explore beyond what our physical bodies are capable of. The challenges of Human Spaceflight remain of great concern, and need to be managed before being able to venture beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. The effects of microgravity on the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, bone mechanics, myology, and the vestibular system are not yet completely understood. Current available countermeasures are not sufficient to assure that astronauts will be able to adequately perform the necessary tasks upon landing on Mars after a prolonged exposure to microgravity. Even extended duration exposures to 1/6th g on the Moon are of concern. Other important factors to consider are the effects of exposure to solar radiation including heavy ions that are present in galactic cosmic rays. Determining the  time course and magnitude of harmful and potentially life-threatening effects is of utmost importance to inform and prioritize countermeasure development. For this reason, a foundational understanding of the human requirements for future deep space and planetary exploration is necessary. This study will present an overview of our current understanding of the physiological effects of long duration spaceflight and project the impact for deep space missions if we only employ current countermeasures. </p>						</article>

								<p>Space Transportation Systems</p>
								<p>This decade has seen historical worldwide involvement in the space sector. The number of commercial companies building spacecraft is at its highest, and the number of humans going to space is rapidly increasing every month. With its innate curiosity to explore our cosmos, humanity plans to venture further than ever before. Although we have been able to send rovers and other functionally smart spacecraft to the edge of our solar system, human spaceflight beyond LEO comes with added difficulties that we have yet to fully resolve. This undertaking requires a foundational understanding of the requirements for Deep Space Transportation Systems. That includes designing spacecraft that can accommodate efficient propulsion systems for long duration space travel, as well as choosing materials capable of protecting all living beings aboard the vehicle from galactic cosmic rays and solar radiation. Studying existing technologies and recognising where the complexities lie will help in the allocation of resources to tackle the most pressing of issues. Before being able to develop solutions, we must first understand existing scientific achievements that have supported deep space missions to date. This study will review technological advancements in the field, as well as critically assess which open questions are most crucial to deal with. This begins with defining the phases of interplanetary deep space mission operations, consolidating state-of-the-art protective materials for extreme environments, assessing current energy/power generation systems, and finally understanding which propulsion systems could be most efficient for this endeavour. </p>

							<p>Space Architecture</p>
							<p>According to the AIAA Space Architecture Technical Committee, Space Architecture “encompasses architectural design of living and working environments in space related facilities, habitats, and vehicles”. 
To sustain future deep space missions, an understanding of the requirements for habitation systems both during long-duration space travel and upon landing on different celestial bodies is of utmost importance in order to develop effective solutions. Reducing dependencies on Earth for supplies will be crucial as we venture farther within our solar system. This is essential in maximising efficiency and supporting mission objectives. Additionally, it is important to recognise the significance of robust monitoring and communication systems within the facility in increasing safety and performance of astronauts. 
As we venture further from low Earth Orbit (LEO), a foundational understanding of the human requirements for future deep space and planetary exploration is necessary. Never before did humans have the need for Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) to operate independently from Earth for long periods and under different gravitational gradients. For this reason, it is vital for ECLSS to have self-reliant oxygen, water, food and waste management systems. This study will review current advancements in physicochemical and bioregenerative technologies, and critically assess which open questions are most important to deal with. This study will also examine results from recent ground analog missions, while taking into consideration all possible environmental variables at play. Finally, human-system integration is expected to increase safety, efficiency and performance of astronauts; for this reason, by reviewing state-of-the-art monitoring and communications systems for space stations, habitats, and EVA systems, this research can determine where to best allocate resources to tackle the most pressing of issues.
