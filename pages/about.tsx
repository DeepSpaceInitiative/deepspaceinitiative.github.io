        {/* <strong>VISION:</strong> 
				Deep Space Initiative aims to make break borders by making Space Research accessible to everyone around the world.

				<strong>MISSION:</strong>
				Pushing the frontiers of science through collaborative multi and interdisciplinary research.  <br> <br> */}
        {/* <strong>ABOUT US</strong> <br> */}
        The goal of Deep Space Initiative (DSI) is to increase accessibility and
        opportunity for Space research by providing a virtual platform that
        allows for efficient, collaborative, and interdisciplinary research by
        teams, under expert guidance. The main focus of DSI is to expose members
        to real Spaceflight challenges and promote/teach skills in critical
        thinking, problem definition, and solution development in a
        multi-disciplinary collaborative environment. <br /> <br />
        Currently, three main fields of study are considered: Astronaut Health
        and Performance, Space Transportation Systems, and Space Architecture.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        In the first phase, members within teams are given the opportunity to
        build a strong foundational understanding of the topic in order to
        define research questions. In the second phase, small sub-teams are
        identified and each sub-team works on solving a specific research
        question within that topic. It is a goal of DSI to provide funding for
        hands-on experimental work through grants, partnerships, fundraising,
        and donations. This will provide an opportunity to at least one member
        per team to conduct experiments in institutional labs or ground analog
        stations.
